# MernstackProject
This project is a full-stack web application which is a social media platform for developers.
The project is made using the MERN tech stack, for hashing and salting I've used BcryptJS and for creating tokens, Jwt is used. I have used Redux for state management and axios to connect both the front end and the back end.
